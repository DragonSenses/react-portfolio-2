# react-portfolio-2
 Web portfolio made with React and TailwindCSS

# Description
A minimalist portfolio website made using React.js, TailwindCSS and artwork generated by Midjourney AI. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite), a front-end build tool.

Installed [React and Tailwind CSS with Vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite).
