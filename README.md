# react-portfolio-2
 A single-page web portfolio made with React, Vite and TailwindCSS

# Description

A minimalist, one-page portfolio website created using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and artwork generated by Midjourney AI. This immaculate portfolio template showcases skills, projects, and contact information. The goal is to offer a succinct overview of one's work and make it easy for visitors to explore.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite), a front-end build tool.

Check out my journey as I made this in [`journey.md`](journey.md)
